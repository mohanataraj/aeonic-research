# Aeonic Research Page

Welcome to my aeon research page, which basically means research that would last my life time rather than other definitions. 

The purpose of the page is to find answers to some of the most important unresolved questions and work on  some of the top tier research projects which involves in answering either the toughest questions or that makes a huge impact for humanity. 

Even though I work in the field of mathematics - research is absolutely done in solitude (no interest to work with anyone here), but most of technology and biology - drug development for CANCER are free and open  to use. 

I do have a seperate blog page as well. Where I blog about mathematical concepts, technological and bioinfomatics projects.
